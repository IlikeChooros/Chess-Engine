## Move generation
- [ ] Generate all possible moves for a given board state:
  - [x] Pawn moves:
    - [x] Valid pinned pawn moves -> when a pawn is pinned to the king, and tries to enpassant capture
    - [x] Promotion moves (-.-)
  - [x] Overall:
    - [x] When king is in check -> the first check works fine, but every subsequent check the pieces doesn't care about the king's situation
    - [x] king check detection -> valid move generation for king when in check by sliding pieces
    - [x] Perft test 
    - [x] Game over detection
    - [x] 50 move rule detection
    - [x] Threefold repetition detection
  - [x] UCI basic commands
    - [x] `uci`
    - [x] `isready`
    - [x] `ucinewgame`
    - [x] `position` (fen, startpos)
    - [x] `go` (perft, search)
    - [x] `stop`
    - [x] `quit`
  - [ ] Search
    - [x] Quiescence search
    - [x] Move ordering
      - [x] History heuristic (for quiet moves)
      - [x] For captures: MVV/LVA
    - [x] Iterative deepening
    - [x] Time management
    - [x] Engine badly detects treefold repetition (user may force a draw in a winning position for the engine)
    - [ ] Engine can't win winning endgames:
      - [ ] KQ vs k
      - [ ] KR vs k
    - [x] BUG: King sometimes can be captured:
      - 6k1/5pp1/1Q2b2p/4P3/7P/8/3r2PK/3q4 w - - 1 34
      - r4rk1/pppb1p2/3bq2p/3NN2Q/2B3p1/8/PP1R2PP/4R2K b - - 0 23
