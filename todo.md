## Move generation
- [ ] Generate all possible moves for a given board state:
  - [x] Pawn moves:
    - [x] Valid pinned pawn moves -> when a pawn is pinned to the king, and tries to enpassant capture
    - [x] Promotion moves (-.-)
  - [x] Overall:
    - [x] When king is in check -> the first check works fine, but every subsequent check the pieces doesn't care about the king's situation
    - [x] king check detection -> valid move generation for king when in check by sliding pieces
    - [x] Perft test 
    - [x] Game over detection
    - [x] 50 move rule detection
    - [x] Threefold repetition detection
  - [ ] Search
    - [x] Move ordering
      - [x] History heuristic (for quiet moves)
      - [x] For captures: MVV/LVA
    - [x] Iterative deepening
    - [x] Time management
